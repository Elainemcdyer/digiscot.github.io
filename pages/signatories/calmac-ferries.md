CalMac is delighted to pledge our support for digital participation in Scotland.

Through our Digital Unions Project, we have developed workplace learning opportunities around digital skills for all employees.

‘Train the Trainer’ courses have been delivered to staff who already have some experience of digital skills. This enables them to assist their fellow colleagues to advance their basic online skills. 

A free digital skills audit is also on offer. This gives all employees the opportunity to get an accurate report of their own level of digital skills and allows us to develop learning solutions that best suit their needs.
